tatic variable in Java is variable which belongs to the class and initialized only once at the start of the execution. It is a variable which belongs to the class and not to object(instance ). Static variables are initialized only once, at the start of the execution. These variables will be initialized first, before the initialization of any instance variables.

    A single copy to be shared by all instances of the class
    A static variable can be accessed directly by the class name and doesn’t need any object

Syntax :

<class-name>.<variable-name>

What is Static Method in Java?

Static method in Java is a method which belongs to the class and not to the object. A static method can access only static data. It is a method which belongs to the class and not to the object(instance). A static method can access only static data. It cannot access non-static data (instance variables).

    A static method can call only other static methods and can not call a non-static method from it.
    A static method can be accessed directly by the class name and doesn’t need any object
    A static method cannot refer to "this" or "super" keywords in anyway

Syntax :

<class-name>.<method-name>

Note: main method is static, since it must be accessible for an application to run, before any instantiation takes place. 

 The static block is a block of statement inside a Java class that will be executed when a class is first loaded into the JVM. A static block helps to initialize the static data members, just like constructors help to initialize instance members.

class Test{
 static {
 //Code goes here
 }
}
